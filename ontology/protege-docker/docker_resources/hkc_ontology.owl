	rdfs:comment """The holistic knowledge cleaning ontology represents important features of knowledge cleaning. These features include knowledge cleaning approaches, techniques and backgroundknowledge. It aims to provide the context from which knowledge cleaning can be performed.

The ontology proviedes means to select approaches for a custom cleaning process, depending on for example, the knowledge graph and available additional cleaning sources. After the selection the approaches need to be applied, this application is represented by the Application algorithm and logic classes."""@en .
